1. Spaces vs. tabs, this looks pretty ugly on github, looks fine with tab width of 2 spaces
2. Proper verification of all problems, toy and bigger are manually verified so far, heat_DN not verified at all
3. Timing and scripts to do automated runs and output run statistics
4. Proper documentation, using doxygen?
